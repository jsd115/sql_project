# SQL Project Using SQLAlchemy

## Project Overview
This project leverages the power to create local databases from `SQLAlchemy` and `Pandas`. The project queries the database and yields new dataframe object that are used to create charts using `Plotly`. 
The final step is then creating a `Dash` application to convey the visualizations in a deployable and interpretable manner. 

## Libraries Used
